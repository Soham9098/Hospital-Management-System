Hospital Management System


Hospital Management System is a system enabling hospitals to manage information and data related to all aspects of healthcare – processes, providers, patients, and more, which in turn ensures that processes are completed swiftly and effectively. When one thinks of the various aspects and departments of a hospital, it becomes apparent that an HMS is critical. The hospital database management system was introduced in 1960, and has greatly evolved since then – with the ability to integrate with the existing facilities, technologies, software, and systems of a hospital. Today, patients can begin the process of healthcare in the palm of their hand – the mobile devices and apps – make this possible. This process then moves to the healthcare providers and hospitals.

#Problem Statement

In this busy world we don’t have the time to wait in infamously long hospital queues. The 
problem is, queuing at hospital is often managed manually by administrative staff, then take a token 
there and then wait for our turn then ask for the doctor and the most frustrating thing - we went there 
by traveling a long distance and then we come to know the doctor is on leave or the doctor can’t take 
appointments.
 HMS will help us overcome all these problems because now patients can book their appointments 
at home, they can check whether the doctor they want to meet is available or not. Doctors can also 
confirm or decline appointments, this help both patient and the doctor because if the doctor declines’ 
appointment, then patient will know this in advance and patient will visit hospital only when the doctor 
confirms’ the appointment this will save time and money of the patient. Patients can also pay the 
doctor’s consultant fee online to save their time.
 HMS is essential for all healthcare establishments, be it hospitals, nursing homes, health clinics, 
rehabilitation centres, dispensaries, or clinics. The main goal is to computerize all the details regarding 
the patient and the hospital. The installation of this healthcare software results in improvement in 
administrative functions and hence better patient care, which is the prime focus of any healthcare unit.
